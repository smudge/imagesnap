# imagesnap

> A CLI for capturing images on macOS üì∑ üì∏ üñºÔ∏è

This crate also doubles as a Rust library. ü¶Ä

## Installing

### via Homebrew

```
brew install smudge/smudge/imagesnap
```

### via Cargo

[Set up Rust/Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html)
and install from crates.io by running:

```
cargo install imagesnap
```

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface

Run the command without any arguments to output `snapshot.jpg`, captured from the default camera:

```bash
$ imagesnap
Capturing image from device "iSight"..................snapshot.jpg
```

The filename can be changed by specifying an argument. Only JPG files are currently supported:

```bash
$ imagesnap shot1.jpg
Capturing image from device "iSight"..................shot1.jpg
```

Use the `-l` flag to list all available image capture devices:

```bash
$ imagesnap -l
iSight
DV
```

Use the `-d` flag to use a specific device:

```bash
$ imagesnap -d DV
Capturing image from device "DV"..................snapshot.jpg
```

Use the `-w` flag to specify a warmup period (default is 0.5), allowing the camera to perform light balancing and/or focus before taking a shot:

```bash
$ imagesnap -w 2.5
Capturing image from device "iSight"...........................snapshot.jpg
```

Use the `-q` flag to silence the status and progress output.

Lastly, run the command with `-h`/`--help` to see usage instructions.

### Rust API

In addition to a CLI, `imagesnap` can be pulled-in as a dependency for other Rust crates:

```
imagesnap = "0.0.1"
```

To snap an image with the default camera, use `Camera::default`:

```rust
let camera = Camera::default();
camera.snap("snapshot.jpg").await;
```

Note that `snap` is an `async` function.

If more than one camera is attached, use `Camera::new` and specify a device:

```rust
let camera = Camera::new(Device::find("FaceTime"), None);
```

To discover all devices, use `Device::all()`.

An optional warmup period may also be specificied (in seconds):

```
let camera = Camera::new(Device::default(), 1.5);
```

If left unspecified, it will default to 0.5 seconds.

## Todo:

- [X] Basic functionality working (snap image to file)
- [X] Add additional opts like 'quiet' and 'warmup'
- [X] Get device selection working
- [X] Clean up code, work on generic lib interface
- [X] Update README with library usage
- [ ] Support additional file types? (png, tif, etc?)
- [ ] Add Linux support (via `rscam`)
- [ ] Add Windows support (via `escapi`)
- [ ] Get STDOUT and pipe detection working (macOS/linux)
